    MY FAV HOBBY ORIGAMI, I LOVE TO CREAT DIFFRENT KINDS OF PAPER CRAFT. LIKE PAPER DECRORATION, PAPER TOYS, PAPER CARDS AND PAPER WALLHANGINGS ETC.Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
